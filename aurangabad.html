  <!----Aurangabad Information--->
  <section class="info">
    <h1>Aurangabad</h1>
    <p>Aurangabad laid low through most of the tumultuous history of medieval India and only hit the spotlight when the
      last Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb, made the city his capital from 1653 to 1707. With the emperor’s death came the
      city’s rapid decline, but the brief period of glory saw the building of some fascinating monuments, including
      Bibi-qa-Maqbara, a Taj Mahal replica, and these continue to draw a steady trickle of visitors. Alongside other
      historic relics, such as a group of ancient Buddhist caves, these Mughal relics make Aurangabad a good choice for
      a weekend excursion from Mumbai. But the real reason for traipsing here is because the town is an excellent base
      for exploring the World Heritage Sites of Ellora and Ajanta.</p>
